        <p>Sakurai has a large outfit design portfolio, which can be seen on both her ko-fi and deviantART, both linked
            at the end.<br /><br />She also has some front-end projects done, as well as some code snippets done for
            toyhou.se, the latter being for character sheets as well as a showcase of outfits.</p>
        <p>The library of projects will keep growing, and during her breaks, she will stream some of it, including videogames!</p>
